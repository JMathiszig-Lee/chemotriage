# Project Bernadette

Bernadette is a decision tree application aiming to help Grandparents or other carers recognize their status as a Kinship Carer and prepare them for getting connected with the organization, Grandparents Plus. 

## Target Group 
Confused newbies:
Chat about situation, what's available.
Some old hands move into this group.

## User Journey

Bernadette is prompted with questions to ascertain whether or not she is a kinship carer

## User Stories

### As a user, Bernadette can:

- See some button/link that grabs her attention and leads her to more information
- Can click on the button and be taken to a new screen to begin answering questions
- See her progress through the series of questions (progress bar)
- See some predefined answers to help her answer the questions
- Edit her choice after she’s made a decision (select a new option)
- Receive some information (short bullet list/link to further resources) 
- Be presented with an option to “book” a phone call
- Submit a form with information about herself to receive a call for more information

## Gitflow

 - assign yourself to an issue and add `in-progress` label :traffic_light:
 - starts work on issue
 - commit work referencing issue add maybe adds an [emoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) :smile:
 - create a pull request
     - reference issue
     - add description of work completed
     - `assign` all of your team
     - if you are still working on the PR add [WIP] to the title (work in progress)
- __everybody__ in the team reviews the PR - **IMPORTANT!!!** :warning:
- the creator of the PR should respond to all the questions and/or make changes requested (or say why don't want to change has to be a good reason)
- the final team member to review should `assign` the QA and add `awaiting-review` label :clock1:
- the QA will review and reassign the creator of the PR and unassign themself :wave:
- this step repeats until the PR can be merged :twisted_rightwards_arrows: and the branch deleted :x:
